TSA 2023 Canceled Remake of Nationals Game

## Installation

Run ```git clone https://github.com/Mushakushi/LettersWithMeAndYou.git``` and open the project with Unity 2022.2.11. From there, run the project in the editor.

## Controls

This game was designed to be played with two players on one keyboard: 

WASD/Arrow Keys - Movement
F/Right Shift - Perform an action 
Escape - Opens the pause menu; only Player 1 can control the pause menu.

This game was discontinued because I was unable to make it to the national competition where this project placed in. For that reason, only the first level is available although a second beta level is accessible. 
I currently have no plans to finish the game, but this repository is primarily useful due to the completed and underlying game management systems beneath the unfinished game.
