Source code of canceled national TSA 2023 entry. The "full" game can be played on Windows in the releases tab.

Escape - Opens the pause menu; only Player 1 can control the pause menu.

*the following assets were used but are not included in this repository:*

### Fonts
- friendly scribbles font from kmlgames: https://kmlgames.itch.io/friendly-scribbles
  - What a cute font; it's one of the few assets that were exactly what I was looking for. 
- NT Fabulous from Artem Nevsky: https://www.dafont.com/nt-fabulous.font
  - The main UI font.

### UI Graphics
- Xelu's Free Controllers & Keyboard Prompts from thoseawesomeguys: https://opengameart.org/content/free-keyboard-and-controllers-prompts-pack
  - I would've spent a month making this. 
- Simple Spinner (progress indicators for UI) from Hippo: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/simple-spinner-progress-indicators-for-ui-237500#content
  - These are surprisingly clean and gave a strong sense of professionalism to the game. 

### Environment  
- flooded grounds from Sandro T.: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/flooded-grounds-48529
  - It's odd this is free. 
- Fantasy Skybox FREE from Render Knight: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/fantasy-skybox-free-18353
- Children's Wooden Toys Train Pack from GroundHog Studios: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/children-s-wooden-toys-train-pack-97440
  - This is the heart of the game. 
- Levers, Buttons and Switches from Meanwhile On The Moon: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/interior/levers-buttons-and-switches-75687
  - These are better than a highlight shader, or a neon-yellow x-mark on a crate. 

### Character Models 
- Unity Humanoid Model Female 021 Free 3D model from 3d-souemonks: https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/character/woman/unity-humanoid-model-female-021
  - As with the following model, I'm happy I could find them. Looking for an appropriate, free model is no easy task. Player 1's model. 
- Unity Humanoid Model Male 014 Free 3D model from 3d-souemonks: https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/character/man/unity-humanoid-model-male-014
  - Player 2's model. Equally fabulous.

This game was discontinued because I was unable to make it to the national competition where this project placed in. For that reason, only the first level is available although a second beta level is accessible. 
I currently have no plans to finish the game, but this repository is primarily useful due to the completed and underlying game management systems beneath the unfinished game.
